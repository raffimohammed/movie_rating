Because the instructions were not clear as to whether partial matches of the title can be returned I chose two built two python programs. The first one will return if there is an exact match of the title. The second program will return all partial matches in the title. 
	Example of an exact match:
		root@afa3104ee0f8:/# /movie_rating_exact_match.py  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
		The movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 84%.
	Example of partial matches:
		root@afa3104ee0f8:/# /movie_rating_partial_match.py  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
		The movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 84%.
		The movie Bonus Round: The Making of 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' does not have a Rotten Tomatoes rating.
